Re2c is a free and open-source lexer generator for C, C++ and Go.
It compiles regular expressions to determinisitic finite automata
and encodes the automata in the form of a program in the target language.
The main advantages of re2c are speed of the generated code and a flexible user interface
that allows one to adapt the generated lexer to a particular environment and input model.
Re2c supports fast and lightweight submatch extraction with either POSIX or leftmost greedy semantics.
Re2c is used in other open-source projects such as
`php <http://php.net/>`_,
`ninja <https://ninja-build.org/>`_,
`yasm <http://yasm.tortall.net/>`_,
`spamassassin <https://spamassassin.apache.org/>`_,
`BRL-CAD <http://brlcad.org/>`_
and `wake <https://github.com/sifive/wake>`_, etc.
