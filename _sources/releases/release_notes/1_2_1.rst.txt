Release 1.2.1
=============

This is a minor release that improves some of the features introduced in 1.2.
First, it is now possible to reset ``re2c:eof`` configuration to the
default value by setting it to ``-1``. Second, re2c now installs standard
include files to ``$(datadir)/re2c/stdlib``, where ``$(datadir)`` is
``/usr/share`` by default (but can be configured otherwise). When looking for
include files, re2c automatically tries this directory --- there is no need
to add it manually with ``-I``.
Both issues have been reported by Wesley W. Terpstra. Thank you!
