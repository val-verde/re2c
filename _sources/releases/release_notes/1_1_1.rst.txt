Release 1.1.1
=============

This is a minor bug-fix release.
It fixes a crash with ``-V`` ``--vernum`` option.
The crash was reported and fixed by Mike Gilbert,
and later rediscovered by Daniel J. Luke and Perry E. Metzger.
Sergei Trofimovich made a unit test, as the ``-V`` ``--vernum`` option has already caused some troubles in the past.
See the changelog :ref:`releases/changelog/changelog:1.1.1 (2018-08-30)` for details.
Thanks everyone!
