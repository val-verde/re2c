Release 2.0.2
=============

This is a minor bugfix release.
It makes two changes.
First, re2go is now built by default (can be turned off with
``--disable-golang`` for Autotools and ``-DRE2C_BUILD_RE2GO=no`` for CMake).
Second, CMake build files are now packaged into release tarball.
See the changelog :ref:`releases/changelog/changelog:2.0.2 (2020-08-08)` for details.
